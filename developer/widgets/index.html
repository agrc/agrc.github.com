<h3>Save yourself some time and use our widgets!</h3>
<p><img src="http://gis.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/widget.png" class="alignleft" /></p>
<p>AGRC is actively developing and maintaining a core set of geospatial javascript widgets and ArcMap Addons.  These widgets allow for developers and non-developers to incorporate geospatial functionality into their website, blog, or GIS environment.  All of our widgets and addons are powered by our <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/developer/web-services">geospatial web APIs</a> that you can also use to create your own addons and wigdets.</p>
<p>A great place to get started with our javascript widgets is the <a href="https://github.com/agrc/agrc.widgets">GitHub repository</a>.  Checkout the test pages to see the widgets in action.  Also, all of our public websites are using the widget library so you may already be familiar with them!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, our widget library allows you to have a user locate things by<br />
[list style="list4"]
<ul>
<li>Geocode their address with the FindAddress Widget - Type in an address and get a UTM or latitude longitude coordinate, optionally zooming a map to the location.</li>
<li>Find anything based on an attribute with the FindGeneric widget - Zoom a map to any layer in our SGID. eg: Zoom to county or municipality.</li>
<li>Find valid township, range, and sections with the TRSsearch widget - Zoom a map or get the formatted TRS value from this widget.</li>
</ul>
<p>[/list] </p>
<p>You can also quickly add common mapping elements: map, base map selector, etc to your website or blog.</p>
