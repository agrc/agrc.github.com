### GISAC Tasks

- Minimum metadata standard for Utah
- Use AGRC's geocoding and address validation tool as a starting point.
- Provide guidelines for AGOL tags
- A data maturity assessment checklist
- Statewide directory of GIS professionals/contacts
- ✔️ A GISAC page, part of gis.utah.gov
- A list of what each of us has for GIS software and hardware, maybe there is an opportunity to share some things or do a quick task for one another.
- An executive summary of what GISAC is and does
- A doc that tells how GIS helps run the business of government. In other words, stories of how GIS streamlines business processes for the agencies we represent
- An index of IT and GIS widgets available to all or at least implemented and proven successful (i.e., repeatable)
