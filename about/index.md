About AGRC

AGRC is the State of Utah’s map technology office. 

AGRC is directed under state statutes to coordinate GIS resources within state government including the management of the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) and the operation of The Utah Reference Network for Global Positioning Systems (TURNGPS) that provides high precision correction services for surveying, mapping, and machine control.

AGRC was one of the first geospatial information offices in the country, established a few years before its formal adoption in code in AGRC and the CIO’s office compose the Integrated Technologies division within the Department of Technology Services.

AGRC is funded through a combination of State general and restricted funds and cost-recovery revenue from project work and grant awards. This hybrid approach ensures a base for SGID and coordination activities but keeps us on our toes by requiring us to keep up with the latest developments in our field.
