## About AGRC

### Background

AGRC is the State of Utah’s map technology coordination office. AGRC staff [contact info](http://gis.utah.gov/about/contact/)have expertise in geographic information system (GIS) desktop software, hosted map and web services, mapping data resources, GIS activity happening around the state. We are located on the 5th floor of the State Office building, directly north of the Capitol [directions and parking](http://gis.utah.gov/about/visiting-agrc/).

AGRC is directed under [mapping-related sections of Utah statute](http://gis.utah.gov/about/code/) to coordinate GIS resources within state government including the management of the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) and the operation of [The Utah Reference Network for Global Positioning Systems (TURNGPS)](http://turngps.utah.gov) that provides high precision correction services for surveying, mapping, and machine control.

AGRC was one of the first geospatial information offices in the country, established a few years before its formal adoption in code in 1984. AGRC and the CIO’s office compose the Integrated Technologies division within the Department of Technology Services.
