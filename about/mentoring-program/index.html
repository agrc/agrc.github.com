<p>The Utah K-12 Educator Mentoring program is designed to help K-12 educators link up with GIS professionals in a mentoring relationship. The Utah State Board of Education, ESRI, AGRC, UGIC, and the Utah GIS Alliance have worked to introduce GIS technology into the Public Education process.  Arrangements have been initiated that will eventually allow the placement of ESRI's ArcView software on the teaching computer systems (classroom and computer lab systems) in all Public and Private K-12 school districts in the State of Utah.  Procedures are also being developed that will allow access to District and possibly State wide geographic data by every school district.  However, as you may be aware educators are currently being stretched.  Throwing a new computer program at them along with all of the GIS concepts and standards with no additional support will not be a service to anyone.  Therefore, UGIC would like to provide a list of GIS professionals who would be willing to mentor both educators and the GIS activities within a school district</p>
