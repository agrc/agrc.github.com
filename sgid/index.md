Established in State law in 1991, Utahâ€™s State Geographic Information Database (SGID) provides one-stop download and web service access to hundreds of GIS map data layers developed, aggregated, or acquired by state government. Today, interoperable GIS server technology has diminished the importance of a completely centralized map data repository. But, it's actually more critical that the latest and best quality GIS data resources are readily discovered and accessed. And that's true for resources available to users as downloadable shapefiles as well as resources available as connections to live streaming data services. AGRC strives to ensure that the SGID stays current as a state-level channel to aide in the discovery, access, and use of GIS data resources.

Following are different ways to access SGID data.

- [Open SGID]({% link sgid/open-sgid/index.md %})
