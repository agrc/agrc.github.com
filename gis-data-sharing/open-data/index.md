The following list outlines how to share data through the [SGID Open Data](http://opendata.gis.utah.gov/) website.

- Although not required, we like to have a user named with the department’s name/function to be the one to share the data. AGRC uses a user called `UtahAGRC` to share all SGID authoritative data. This allows users to quickly determine the source of the data and the potential value of the data.
- For data to be shared within the SGID, we prefer to share single feature type feature layers. So, one data type and theme within a feature layer. This allows the greatest flexibility for the end users of the data.
- Having an accurate title (Using Utah as a first identifier and spaces between words), summary and description are needed to allow users to discover your data.
- For tagging data to be included within the ArcGIS Online SGID we start general and work to specific. Using county boundaries as an example, we use `AGRC, SGID` as suggested tags. Please include SGID and the ISO data category (e.g., `Boundaries`, `Water`, `Transportation` etc.) when tagging for inclusion in the SGID Open Data. You can omit tags if the layer title contains them since they are then unnecessary. Don’t forget to include your agency/department name as well.
- Please make sure that the data is shared publicly with everyone, and include the appropriate SGID Group to share with. This will allow us to make your data available through our open-data portal.
- If you are the steward of the data and the data is considered authoritative, you can mark it as Authoritative data so that users will be able to tell at a glance that it is good data.
- Please check the box to `Allow others to export to different formats` located at the bottom of the Settings page for the data.
