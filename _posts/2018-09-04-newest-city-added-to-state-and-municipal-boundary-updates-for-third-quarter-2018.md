We would like to welcome the newest incorporated town Bluff, in San Juan County.
Joining the stateâ€™s growing list of towns on July 19th, they become the 248th municipality.
With a estimated population of around 320 people, that put them down in 214th place population wise, but their 37 square miles of area ranks them just in in the top ten at number nine. As temps cool down and fall rolls in head down to the southeast corner and give them a visit.

Meanwhile, it was a quiet summer for annexations throughout the rest of the state, except for in Utah County, which is always expanding.
As always a little reminder for everyone, changes to city boundaries can affect others like voter precincts, or school districts. Be sure to share data with your Clerk offices or others that may have an interest.
Census is coming in 2020 so get all boundaries in order so we can get everything to the US Census Department and in the federal database. 

Following are the changes and annexations since July 6, 2018,  listed by County and City:
