Finally the end of 2020 is here. It has been a challenge for all of us. The hard working folks in the Lt. Governor's Office and all those working in the city and county Recorders Offices havenâ€™t let that slow them down. Utah County once again leads the way with 30 annexations, and Cache County next at 13. Nine other counties follow with 4 to 6 annexations this year. We total out with 98 annexations this year. Not bad all things considered.

The folks out in Erda in Tooele County voted to incorporate so we will be adding them in next year. Unfortunately we lost the Town of Cedar Heights, down in Iron County this year. 

As always feel free to check out all the changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be, view them here: [Utah Municipality Modifications](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63).
