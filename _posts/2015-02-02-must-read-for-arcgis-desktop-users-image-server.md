<p>Begining January 16, 2016 AGRC will no longer support legacy Image Server. This means that users of all versions of ArcGIS Desktop will <strong>not</strong> be able to connect to the SGID Image Server (connections established using the <em>Add Image Server Connection</em> button). All links to Image Server saved within an mxd will be broken. </p>
<p>AGRC recommends that <strong>ALL</strong> ArcGIS Desktop users access the aerial photography and scanned map data layers by using the <code>Add Data > GIS Servers</code> method to connect to AGRC's mapserv.utah.gov server. This method accesses these map layers via the ArcGIS Image Extension for Server. Read how to <a href="{{ "/data/sgid-image-services" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">connect to the new Image Server</a>.
