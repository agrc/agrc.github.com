We are into the third quarter now, almost through the year. While things have slowed down some life goes on. Annexations have been coming through as cities grow and for this year we have two possible new incorporations. One in Tooele County, Erda, and another in Weber County, West Weber. Both will be on the ballots in the coming election. 
Here are the updates for the third quarter.
As always these changes to town and city boundaries can affect other departments too, be sure to share your data with others.
