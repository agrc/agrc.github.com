End of the year and here are the final tally for Annexations in 2017. 
We have another new city down in Iron County this time Cedar Highlands, on the east side of Cedar City in the foothills.
Total number of Annexations and Disconnections processed this year is on par with last year at 89 …., County with the most is Utah County again and the City with the most is a tie, both American Fork and Layton had 7.
Thanks to all the City and County personal who are responsible for this work.
Another reminder the 2020 Census will be coming up soon so it’s a good time to review your data and get any missing areas included. We will be submitting data to Census BAS program again early in the new  year, they do like to see documentation of some kind for all areas included. 
Current Municipality data can be downloaded from the data page State, County, and Municipal Boundaries., and can be view online at the following links.
You can always contact us for more information mheagin@utah.gov, agrc@utah.gov
