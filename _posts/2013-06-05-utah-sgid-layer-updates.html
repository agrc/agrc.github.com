<p>AGRC has updated some layers in the State Geographic Information Database (SGID). The updates are a result of the work that's been done for the Utah Broadband Project's, Community Anchor Institutions layer. During this update process AGRC did some house cleaning and consolidated some layers, with a common theme, into one layer. The layer that was consolidated has been removed from the SGID.</p>
<p>The updated SGID layers are:<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.Schools<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.Libraries<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.CorrectionalFacilities (consolidated from Jails)<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.LawEnforcement (consolidated from Police Stations)<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.FireStations<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.BLMFieldOffices<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.ForestServiceStations<br />
* SGID10.SOCIETY.PostOffices<br />
* SGID10.HEALTH.HealthCareFacilities (consolidated from Hospitals, Urgent Care, and Elderly Care Facilities)<br />
* SGID10.HEALTH.EmergencyMedicalServices (consolidated from EMS Facilities)</p>
