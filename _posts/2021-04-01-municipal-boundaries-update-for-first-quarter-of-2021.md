A new year, a new start for the state. While everyone starts the year still under the pandemic restrictions and have been now for a little more than a year, growth still goes on.

It has been a slower start to the year as things change with an election and changes to county and city personal. The last Lt. Governor is now the Governor and we have a new Lt. Governor and some new staff, who are in charge of annexation and boundaries in the state.
Welcome Lt Governor Henderson and any new staff who will be working with us.

Stay safe and healthy. As always feel free to check out all the changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be, view them here: [Utah Municipality Modifications](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63 )

To review the documents you can go here: [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://municert.utah.gov/) Changes may be coming for this location, more on this later.
