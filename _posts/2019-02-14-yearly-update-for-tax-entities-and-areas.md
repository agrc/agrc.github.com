As of January 28, weâ€™re officially in tax season, and AGRC can help you stay informed about taxation in Utah! We have updated our 2018 year-end tax entity data, and you can access the data on the [Sales Tax Areas and Tax Entity Areas page](https://gis.utah.gov/data/economy/taxingareas/) of the AGRC website. 

#### Newest Tax Entities for 2018

The [Tax Entities dataset](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F_gcgx68eaco_KPoKaiygD2ehzuDEudZ&sa=D&ust=1550186734827000&usg=AFQjCNGDEpHwYonefD9gUJBqYa1zEvORJA) contains the 2018 year-end data for all tax entities, such as school districts, cities, special service districts, and even mosquito abatement districts, that have the power to levy a local property tax. While these areas do not represent exact legal boundaries, they are used by the Utah State Tax Commission, Property Tax Division, for assessing properties.

The [Tax Areas](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F_gcgx68eaco_KPoKaiygD2ehzuDEudZ&sa=D&ust=1550186771768000&usg=AFQjCNGR53iCWfSTRToeCDGYF9NbKa6hdg) for 2018 are individual, unique polygons that show the tax entities for that area. They can include anywhere from 2 up to 24 entities, with an average of 10 entities. These will be the entities that you pay taxes to. Which tax area do you live in?

#### Newest Sales Tax Areas for Quarter 1, 2019

Sales tax areas are created from municipal boundaries, metro townships, special sales tax districts, and  unincorporated areas. They represent the approximate boundaries of sales tax collection areas in Utah. Get the newest sales tax area data with the [Sales Tax Areas dataset](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByStJjVZ7c7mQy1iYXlqQTJLQUE&sa=D&ust=1550186721948000&usg=AFQjCNEpaTHvD8l59FSJmVzOty8IXj3Reg). 

#### Updated Transit Special Tax Areas

Transit special tax areas represent areas outside of incorporated municipalities where additional sales tax is collected to support transit activities (generally buses). As cities grow and annex the unincorporated areas the transit areas get smaller. Check out the updated Transit Special Tax Areas dataset [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByStJjVZ7c7mcVlHOXQ0djUtaEU&sa=D&ust=1550186688195000&usg=AFQjCNF3mO46t3BMv_P_s1e7KxnHnZIzbA).
