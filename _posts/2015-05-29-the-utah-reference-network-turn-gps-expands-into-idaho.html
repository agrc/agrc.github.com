<p><a href="{{ "/wp-content/uploads/IdahoExpansion-Copy.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/images/IdahoExpansion-Copy-300x177.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" title="IdahoExpansion - Copy" width="300" height="177" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17399" /></a>Since 2005, AGRC has administered the Statewide Global Positioning Reference Network. The initial 15 stations have grown to 90 survey grade GPS receivers located across Utah and into three neighboring states. The most recent expansion was into southeastern Idaho after AGRC was approached by Idaho State University about the network. The expansion increases revenue for the network as a whole, as well as improves coverage accuracy by densifying the base station locations.</p>

Legislative and local government support keeps the yearly subscription rate to only $600. These low subscription fees result in more usage, and more accurate locations for surveying monuments, public lands, and private property.  The network is used for a range of precision GPS applications including surveying, engineering, construction, and GIS data collection.  </p>
