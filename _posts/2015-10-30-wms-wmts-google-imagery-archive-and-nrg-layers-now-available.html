<p><img alt="" src="http://gis.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/ArchiveServicesDownload.png" class="alignright" width="301" height="328" />The statewide "utah" imagery service layer displays the most current 6 inch imagery licensed from Google. As a result of the recent 2015 update areas, there are two archive layers available: "utah_2012archive" and "utah_2013archive" that contain the old, replaced imagery organized by original collection year. An additional service "naip_2011_nrg" provides a static view of a Near-Infrared, Red, Green (NRG) layer from the 2011 NAIP collection.</p>
<p>If you are not seeing the archive service or NRG layers simply go to ArcCatalog or ArcMap's Catalog Viewer and right-click the GIS Server connection created to access the imagery service and select Refresh. </p>
<p>The archived imagery layers are available for download from your Web Browser Download link  (link ending in footprint/utah/preview). Where archive imagery is available you have the option to download multiple .jp2-formatted vintages for a tile, "Download All Tiles in Current View" (most current and archived), or "Download Most Recent".</p>
