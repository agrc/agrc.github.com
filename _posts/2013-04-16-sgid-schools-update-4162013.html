<p>Updates were made recently to the SGID10.Society.Schools feature class that resides on the <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/data/how-to-connect-to-the-sgid-via-sde/">Utah SGID ArcSDE database server</a>.</p>
<p>The updated Schools data is also available as shapefiles and file geodatabase files (Libraries are included in this data package) for download on the <a href="ftp://ftp.agrc.utah.gov/UtahSGID_Vector/UTM12_NAD83/SOCIETY/PackagedData/_Statewide/SchoolsLibraries/">SGID FTP site</a>.</p>
<p>Based on information provided by the <a href="http://www.schools.utah.gov/main/">Utah State Office of Education</a> (as of July 2012), the update includes enhancements to the geographic location of schools, address, district information, internal ids, grade levels, and new point locations of schools built since the dataset was originally created in November 2010.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Schools data is now being stored in a more intutive and user friendly schema.  The new schema now includes fields that indicate which Utah House and Senate District each school is located in.    </p>
