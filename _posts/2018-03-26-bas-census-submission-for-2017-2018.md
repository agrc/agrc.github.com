The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) annually to collect information about selected legally defined geographic areas. The BAS is used to update information about the legal boundaries and names of all governments. Utah has an agreement with Census and AGRC shares Utah’s data from the SGID. 

During the year as annexation, disconnections, and incorporations are submitted to the Lt. Governor’s Office, per the state code, AGRC reviews the plat map information and then adjusts and adds the boundaries to the State Geographic Database (SGID). These updates are what is submitted into the BAS program.

In the past local and county governments would submit their own data for their localities and try to insure their legal boundaries and official names were correct. This would influence the official population counts if boundaries are not kept current. Many government agencies and other groups use those population counts to determine the allocation of funds. 

Now, before the 2020 Census it is important to get and keep the boundaries current. With our agreement, local and county governments can now submit their changes once through the Lt. Governor's Office as required in state code. Then the AGRC will submit that data that reflects statewide changes at the end of each year. 

For those interested in seeing what the SGID currently shows for your town, city or county we have created an online map.

It is up to date and will stay that way. The Legend on the left shows modifications for 2018 and 2017 and the current boundaries for municipalities and metro townships. If you want to see older years, go to the Content tab, we have years from 2016 back to 2013, anything from before that is in the final group.  Those can be turned on and off as desired.
