The US Census Bureau conducts the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) annually to collect information about selected legally defined geographic areas. The information collected in this survey is used to update information about the legal boundaries and names of all governments. AGRC has a unique role in the completion of the BAS; in accordance with an agreement between Utah and the US Census Bureau, AGRC shares Utah’s data from the State Geographic Information Database (SGID). 

As information about annexations, disconnections, and incorporations is submitted to the Lieutenant Governor’s Office throughout the year, per the state code, AGRC reviews the plat map information and then adjusts and adds the boundaries to the SGID. These updates are what is submitted for the BAS.

In the past, local and county governments would submit their own data for their localities and try to ensure that their legal boundaries and official names were correct. But this system presented certain challenges&mdash;if the boundary and name information was incorrect or outdated, it would affect official population counts, and many government agencies and other groups use those population counts to determine the allocation of funds.

With the current agreement, local and county governments can now submit their changes once through the Lieutenant Governor's Office, as required in state code. Then the AGRC will compile all of those changes and submit the comprehensive, updated state data for the BAS at the end of each year. It is important for AGRC to get the boundaries updated and to keep them updated before the 2020 Census. 

If you're interested in seeing what the SGID currently shows for your town, city, or county, check out the online [Utah Municipality Modifications](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63) map.

This map is up to date and will stay that way. On the left, you'll see the legend, which shows modifications for 2017 and 2018 and the current boundaries for municipalities and metro townships. If you want to see previous years' boundaries, go to the Content tab. Under that tab, the data from 2013 through 2016 is broken out by year, and data from before 2013 is shown when you select the "MunicipalitiesModificationsPriorTo2013" box. The content boxes can be turned on and off as desired.
