AGRC recently released a major enhancement to the Parcel Web Map Application: [parcels.utah.gov](https://parcels.utah.gov). Beyond a new modernized look and improved parcel pop up, the application now allows a user to search by parcel ID. High resolution imagery from Google was also added to the application. Finally, the application allows for a direct link to a county.
