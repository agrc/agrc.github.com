AGRC recently completed updates to the SGID Roads feature class. Please visit our [Roads and Highway System]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}) data page where you will find information about the Roads data model, as well as direct download links to the SGID Roads data in shapefile and geodatabase format.

These updates are also reflected in AGRC's [address locators]({% link data/address-geocoders-locators/index.html %}), Utah's [Next-Generation 911 GIS database]({% link data/911/index.html %}), and AGRC's [street network analysis datasets]({% link data/transportation/street-network-analysis/index.html %}).

The following are highlights from this month's update.

#### County Updates

New roads were added and road names and address ranges were updated for the following counties:

- **Cache County:** Obtained roads data on 05/19/2021. Previous update was on 12/04/2020.

Notes: The US Forest Service identified about 3,000 decommissioned road segments that existed in this dataset. Based on their recommendations, UGRC removed those segments and that work is reflected in this update. You can find transportation data managed by the Forest Service on their [FSGeodata Clearinghouse](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=transportation).

#### UDOT Route System

- The [SGID LRS page]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}#HighwayLinearReferencingSystemRoutes) now points to UDOT's newest Advanced LRS (ALRS) data.
