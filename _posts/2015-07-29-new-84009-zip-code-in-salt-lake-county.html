<p>The US Postal Service recently assigned a <a href="http://about.usps.com/news/state-releases/ut/2015/ut_2015_0522.htm">new zip code, 84009</a>, to be used for the portion of the existing 84095 South Jordan area that is west of the Bangerter Highway. The assignment took effect July 1st with a 1 year grace period for mail carrying the previous zip code for that area.</p>
<p>AGRC has made this change to the ZipCode boundary polygons on our SDE database and FTP file servers. The zip code attributes carried on the statewide road centerline and address point GIS map layers are expected to be updated by the end of next week (8/7/15).</p>
<p>And, the AGRC geocoding web service, which allows the use of either zip code or placename for the match zone parameter, has been updated and will allow for use of either zip code indefinitely for this area.</p>
