<p>As your JavaScript projects get more and more complex, loading all of your Dojo javascript files can really slow down your load time. All those dojo.require calls add up in a hurry. The Dojo Build System can be a huge help in speeding up the load time and general performance of your apps. For example, a build that I ran on a recent project took the number of JavaScript requests on page load from 53 down to 5. The css requests went from 16 down to 4. This ended up <strong>cutting the load time in half</strong>! Other nice features include stripping out all of the console calls, minifying your JavaScript and interning all of your widget templates.</p>
