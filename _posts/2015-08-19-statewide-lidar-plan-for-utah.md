The plan includes the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/document/d/1Z7QPeg9whuOnZP_Y_jOnkZrJsj6hVpqrp3vSkUJhEac/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>Lidar Plan strategy document</a></strong> and <strong><a href="{{ "/downloads/LidarPlan.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">map of statewide coverage priority and quality level specification goals</strong></a>. </p>

<p>The aim of this plan is to provide strategy and vision for Lidar data acquisitions across the State of Utah and to promote partnerships, cost sharing, and timely, prioritized acquisitions.</p>

<p>The coverage priority map breaks the state into 6 classifications representing priorities relating to transportation, infrastructure, natural hazards, private lands, etc. At this time, the coverage map doesn't attempt to break the state into operational flight/acquisition blocks. The 6 categories are:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Priority level 1: heavily urbanized areas; high profile water, watershed, and land management areas, or prioritized hazard study areas</li>
<li>Priority level 2: transportation and settled area corridors, high profile recreation areas </li>
<li>Priority level 3F: forest management areas</li>
<li>Priority level 3P: other private land or areas with substantial economic value/activity (note: a large portion of the Uintah Basin oil and gas field is expected to be moved to this priority level)</li>
<li>Priority level 4: designated wilderness management areas with external impact (wildfire, watershed) and recreation interests</li>
<li>Priority level 5: other areas, moderate economic development potential</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first draft of a living document that is expected to be refined as additional feedback is received and analyzed, and as areas get collected and/or re-prioritized.</p>
<p>We encourage you to send any feedback you may have on the plan or coverage priority map to <a href="mailto:rkelson@utah.gov"><strong>Rick Kelson</strong></a>. </p>
