It’s already over three-quarters of the way through the year, and while things slowed down at AGRC during the summer, we’re trying to catch up now that it's fall. We're still expecting annexations to pick up as we head for the end of the year (there are plenty of procrastinators out there). In the meantime, here are our updates for the third quarter.

As always, these changes to town and city boundaries can affect other boundary layers, so be sure to share your data with others.

First, we want to remind everyone that the 2020 census is coming up, and we are still pushing to get the State's data layers as perfect as we can. So please take a look at the State’s data and see whether we are missing anything, or if there is something strange, let us know.

For information about why GIS data is so important to the census process, check out this [census flyer](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/partnerships/GEO_Program_Flyer.pdf).

Municipalities and updates can be viewed on the [Utah Municipality Modifications](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63) web map.
