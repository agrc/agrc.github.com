The updated [Watershed Restoration Initiative (WRI) Application](https://wri.utah.gov/wri/) will be adding a 2016 Digital Government Award to its trophy case this month. WRI was one of 3 winners in the "Driving Digital Government" state government category.({{ "/images/DGAA.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:.inline-text-right} 

The application, built by a partnership between the Division of Wildlife Resources, the Dept. of Technology Services AppDev team, and AGRC, allows for collaborative project proposals, scheduling, funding, tracking, and mapping across the many participating agencies and levels of government. The WRI App integrates GIS-based disgital maps extensively to organize, analyze, and visualize project information.({{ "/images/WRIAppMap2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:.inline-text-right} 

To date, large-scale landscape remediation and improvement projects coordinated and tracked in the WRI environment total almost $200 million. Partnering organizations include 6 state agencies, 8 non-profits, and 5 federal agencies, plus, in some cases, private land owners.

The WRI team includes, pictured from left Steve Gourley, Scott Davis, .....John Angus, and Nathan Kota. And, not pictured are: Kiril Boyadjieff, ......({{ "/images/WRITeam.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:.inline-text-right} 

The most recent [award was announced by the Center for Digital Government](http://www.govtech.com/cdg/digital-government-achievement/Best-of-the-Web-Digital-Government-Achievement-Awards-2016-Winners-Announced.html) that, in addition to its overall 'Best of the Web' portal awards, recognized 30 websites and applications for excellence, from all levels of government.

The WRI app also recently won a Special Achievement Award in GIS from ESRI. 

The ESRI award was accepted by the project partners, representing DNR, DTS, and AGRC, at the ESRI International User Conference in June. Pictured, from left, are Nathan Kota (Senior GIS Analyst, Wildlife Resources), Bill Boudreau (IT Director, DTS-DNR), Jack Dangermond (Founder/President, ESRI), and Bert Granberg (Director, AGRC).({{ "/images/WRIESRI.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:.inline-text-right}
