As mapping applications on mobile devices become increasingly widespread, UGRC is in the early stages of supplementing its raster base map offerings with new vector tiled base maps. The smaller size of vector tiles relative to raster tiles makes them ideal for offline use on mobile devices and allows for faster draw times when viewed in a standard web browser.

Currently in the works is a vector tile version of the Terrain base map; weâ€™re hoping to have the vector tile version available in the coming months. In the meantime, here is a sneak peek.
