The project is designed to examine changes that have taken place and the impacts which have resulted. The maps, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9U0T4P-Rpilb3ZQWTFIZkVZMkU/edit?usp=sharing">downloadable in google earth format</a>, show present day information as well as information from 1935-1952. The project has also digitized many historical <a href="http://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/utahsanbornfireinsurancemaps">Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps</a>, which are an excellent resource for planning. </p>
<p>The Salt Lake City Geoportal was created with a lot of uses in mind, which include uses for geographers, homeowners, and teachers. The data lets a user determine historic context for a given area, discover historic lot information, and explore the history of Salt Lake City in general.
