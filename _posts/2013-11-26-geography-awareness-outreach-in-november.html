<p>In honor of Geography Awareness Week, which was November 17-23, 2013, GIS Day events were held at various locations along the Wasatch Front. GIS Day was held on November 7 in <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9jPX7xfMfYZLU1fMi03cVp4QzQ/edit">Utah County</a>, November 12 in <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2TozNhMXSiebU8xRWxoRFRGQnc/edit">Salt Lake County</a>, and November 18-22 at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2TozNhMXSied3l6eFJlaE41bjg/edit">University of Utah</a>. A big thank you to the Utah Valley User Group, the Utah Geographic Information Council (UGIC), the University of Utah Geography department, and all who volunteered with these events, they were a great success!</p>
