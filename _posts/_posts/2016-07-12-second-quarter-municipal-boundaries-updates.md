Half way through the year already, updates to the Municipal Boundaries are on line now.
Not too many since the May update, but we are back on track now. Delta City has a large expansion to include the airport.
Any of these documents can be reviewed at http://municert.utah.gov/2016-certifications
Enjoy your holidays, and watch those fireworks restrictions. 

The following are the changes/annexations listed by County and City:

Cache - Paradise
Davis - Layton
Millard - Delta (2)
Salt Lake - Sandy
Utah - Alpine, American Fork, Highland (2) Lehi (3)
