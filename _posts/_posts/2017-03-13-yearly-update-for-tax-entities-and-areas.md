We have finished the updates for the Utah State Tax Entities and Areas for 2016. 
The new new data is available online from the Data pages Sales Tax Areas and Tax Entities Areas.
https://gis.utah.gov/data/economy/taxingareas/

Also on the same Data page Transit Special Tax Areas did get some adjustment in the Cache Transit area. These adjustment were done to exclude areas incorporated into the cities that surrounding the entity.
