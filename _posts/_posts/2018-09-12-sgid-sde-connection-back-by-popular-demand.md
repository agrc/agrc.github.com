For those of you who would prefer to access the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) via ESRI’s Spatial Database Engine (ArcSDE) rather than ArcGIS Online or downloads from [gis.utah.gov](https://gis.utah.gov/), you’re in luck. AGRC is bringing back a public connection to an instance of the SGID hosted in the Amazon cloud. 

This instance of the SGID is recommended if you are outside the State of Utah network and you lost your connection when AGRC stopped supporting SDE application server connections. If you are already within the State network and are connecting to the SGID, you should continue to do so using your existing database connection. 
To connect, use the following connection properties:

_Database Platform_: SQL Server
_Instance_: agrc-mssql.cx5yqb6zy0hb.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
_Authentication Type_: Database authentication
_Username_: agrc
_Password_: agrc

You will notice a significant difference in performance between ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap when accessing the database. When making the initial connection, ArcGIS Pro is about three times faster than ArcMap; however, ArcMap is faster than Pro when a layer is added and is first drawn. Go figure . . .

If you have questions or comments about this change, contact Zach Beck.
