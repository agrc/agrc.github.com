At the halfway point in the year, or the beginning of the fiscal year, depending on your nature, things in the state are moving along. We have had an update from Census on population estimates for 2018 that have been included in the data for both the municipalities and counties.
Check those out if you are interested.
As always changes to town and city boundaries can affect other departments too, be sure to share your data with others. 
With the 2020 census coming up we are still pushing to get everything as perfect as we can so take a look at the stateâ€™s data and see if we are missing anything or if there is something strange, and let us know.
