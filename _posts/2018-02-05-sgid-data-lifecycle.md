Over the past several months, AGRC has been updating the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) data lifecycle process. The data lifecycle process starts with data creation and extends to finalizing data for internal and external use. AGRC’s goal is to streamline this process and make data clearer and more accessible for all involved parties, from AGRC to local, state, and federal partners.

The SGID is a comprehensive collection of data, however, not all of that data is used or useful. There are currently hundreds of data layers that need to be studied and more effectively categorized into tiers of data. But in order to categorize this data, AGRC needs to understand: how frequently people use that data (i.e., use metrics), how important that data is to users, and which data layers should be considered to be framework data.

To learn more about each data layer, AGRC tracks the layer’s current usage and who the steward is, whether AGRC or an external steward. (ESRI’s ArcGIS Online product has many metrics available to do this.) AGRC can also track the number of clicks on data download links on [gis.utah.gov]({{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). After tracking data about each layer, AGRC works with external stewards to classify the data to a tier, which has unique associated expectations for quality, update schedule, and availability as a web service.

Once the data layer is assigned to a tier, it is assigned an update schedule and a method of delivery, such as accessible for download from [gis.utah.gov]({{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) or available as a web service. At that point, the data is ready for external use, and users can access the data from the [SGID index]({{ "/data/sgid-index/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), which provides access to the data page and a link to web services.

Analyzing and organizing all the data layers is an extensive task and will be an ongoing effort for AGRC. But once AGRC completes that task, maintenance will be the focus. AGRC plans to build or procure a system that can collect and give feedback to the steward of each data layer, so changes and updates can be made based on that feedback.
