<p>The first map in the spotlight series has been created by the Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) at the Utah Department of Natural Resources to provide timely information on an upcoming hunting event.</p>
<p>The Fall 2013 pheasant hunt begins on November 2nd. DWR plans to release over 11,000 pheasants in Utah throughout the hunt. DWR hopes this rekindles memories of past pheasant hunts, as it introduces a new opportunity to upland game hunters. To illustrate where pheasants will be released, DWR created an <a href="http://j.mp/HjoTB6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive map</a>, which includes a <a href="http://bit.ly/16vOwuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile version</a>.
