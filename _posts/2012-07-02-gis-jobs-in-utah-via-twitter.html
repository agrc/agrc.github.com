<p>Over the years organizations have approached the Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC) to post GIS or mapping-related job recruitments. We are eager to continue accommodating those requests.  However, the mighty staff at AGRC don't often know when those posting expire.  So, to try and continue offering a single resource for GIS jobs in Utah, we simply plan to use Twitter.  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/utmap%20jobs">By searching twitter with the hashtags <strong>#utmap</strong> and <strong>#jobs</strong> together</a>, you can find a list of job openings, starting with the most recently posted jobs.</p>
<p>In fact, anyone can use the same hashtags. If your organization is currently recruiting for a GIS professional, cut out the AGRC middleman and post it directly to Twitter!</p>
