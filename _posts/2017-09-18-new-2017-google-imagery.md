New 2017 high-resolution Google imagery is available from the Discover server. Updated areas include the Salt Lake, Heber, Logan. St. George and Tooele blocks. The new imagery can be found in the `Google` and `Utah` service. The new imagery is not yet available for download and the archive service `Google 2017archive` has not been updated but should be very soon.

ArcMap users will need to clear the cache on the `Google` and `Utah` layers from Discover to see the new imagery. This can be done by going to the serviceâ€™s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Local Cache Now`. Be patient as this could take several minutes. Another option is to clear your entire ArcMap cache by going to `Customize -> ArcMap Options -> Display Cache -> Clear Cache`.

ArcGIS Pro users will also need to clear their cache on the `Google` and `Utah` layers to see the new imagery. This can be done by going to the service's `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Cache`. You can also clear your entire Pro cache by going to a Pro project's `Options -> Display` and check `Clear cache` as selectiong `OK`.

Are you not signed up for access to the Google imagery yet? Visit the [Discover - Imagery and Base Map Server]({{ "/discover/" | prepend:site.baseurl }} "Google imagery license information") page.
