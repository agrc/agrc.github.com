New 2017 high-resolution Google imagery is available from the Discover. Updated areas include the Salt Lake, Heber, Logan. St. George and Tooele blocks. The new imagery can be found in the `Google`, `Utah`, `Basemap-Hybrid`, and `Google 2017archive` services. The new imagery is also available for download.

**ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro users will need to clear their local cache to see the new imagery.** Users can clear their entire ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro caches or clear caches for just the `Google`, `Utah`, and `Basemap-Hybrid` layers. (instructions below)  

- **ArcMap** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Local Cache Now`. Be patient as this could take several minutes. If the blurry tiles persist you have the options to `Clear cache when the session ends` or `Don't cache and data locally`. Another option is to completely clear your ArcMap cache by going to `Customize -> ArcMap Options -> Display Cache -> Clear Cache`.

- **ArcGIS Pro** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Cache`. You can also clear your entire Pro cache by going to the Pro project's `Options -> Display` and check `Clear cache` and selecting `OK`.

Are you not signed up for access to the Google imagery yet? Visit the [Discover - Imagery and Base Map Server]({{ "/discover/" | prepend:site.baseurl }} "Google imagery license information") page.
