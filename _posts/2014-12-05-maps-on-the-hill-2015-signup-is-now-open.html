This event, in its fourth year, is a good opportunity for students and professionals to share maps, mapping tools, and mapping projects with elected officials, fellow practitioners, and the public.</p>
<p><em>Who should participate:</em><br />
Individuals: Anybody who makes a map through their work or education.<br />
Organizations: An organization that has worked on multiple mapping projects.</p>
<p><em>Maps on the Hill Event:</em><br />
The map display event will be held the first Wednesday of the 2015 Legislative session, in the Capitol Rotunda from 10:30 am - 1:30 pm, with set-up time beginning at 9:30am. We request that at least one participant is present to discuss each map entry throughout the display event.</p>
<p><em>Display Types:</em><br />
You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (youâ€™ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.<br />
The focus of the event is interesting maps or map technology projects that are applicable to a wide audience. While displays can be on any appropriate topic, presentations that may be of interest to decision makers are strongly encouraged. Marketing of specific product and services is discouraged.</p>

For Maps on the Hill <a href="{{ "/downloads/2012MapsOnTheHill_bookletSM.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2012</a>, <a href="{{ "/downloads/MapsontheHillMapBook2013.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2013</a>, and <a href="{{ "/downloads/Maps-on-the-Hill-Map-Book-2014-web.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2014</a>, a book was created highlighting all of the map entries. The book has always been a great example of the interesting maps created and used in Utah. This year the mapbook will focus on how mapping and GIS influences important decisions. More information on displays, the book, and other details will be sent to participants sometime after they signup.</p>
