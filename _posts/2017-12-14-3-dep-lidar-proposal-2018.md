Earlier this November, a partnership of Utah organizations submitted a proposal to the USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) for 2018 Lidar acquisition projects.

While we're months away from any preliminary or final funding decisions, the partners are sharing [this updated proposed project area map]({{ "/images/3DEP_Lidar_Proposal_2018.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
 in advance, in an effort to promote coordination and avoid duplication of effort.

The proposed areas break down to the following square mileages by USGS quality levels (QL1-8ppm | QL2-2ppm):

-	QL1 - 1,892
-	QL2 - 7,018
-	QL1 (USGS) â€“ 380
-	QL2 (USGS) - 4,310
