If you manage city or county address data in GIS or other formats, AGRC has a new web page with Utah-specific information about the Census Bureau's Local Update of Census Address program.

The LUCA program is the pipeline to supply Census with best, most up-to-date address data, to best position Utah for a full count in the 2020 census, and a rightful share in census-informed federal funding formulas for everything from the roads to school lunch assistance. 

The new page includes information describing the LUCA program and its schedule. Additionally it serves as a gateway to supporting GIS data, advice on LUCA strategy and prioritization, and resources from the November 2 LUCA training held in Salt Lake City.

For your convenience, AGRC has put a link to the LUCA page on the front page of the gis.utah.gov website -- it's a short scroll down the page on a dark blue background (see red arrow in screenshot).
