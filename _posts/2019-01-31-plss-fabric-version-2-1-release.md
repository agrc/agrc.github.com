AGRC has published [Version 2.1 (V2.1)]({{ "/data/cadastre/plss/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the Utah Public Land Survey System (PLSS) Fabric for the start of 2019.

The PLSS Fabric is the current method for parcel management that allows all of the various PLSS data layers to be updated simultaneously. The Utah PLSS Fabric production version is available for download in several forms from the  [PLSS / GCDB page]({{ "/data/cadastre/plss/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page of the AGRC website. (The file sizes are quite large, so please consider this when downloading.)

As the PLSS Fabric grows, updates will be made every couple of months. Changes and updates will be noted in upcoming newsletters, so sign up below, or keep checking back.
