<p><img alt="" src="http://business.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/Trails-Database-Logo-Large1.jpg" class="alignright" width="300" height="225" />The Governor's Office of Economic Development's Outdoor Recreation Office has partnered with AGRC on a project to build a statewide trails database. A statewide trails database and map will offer something unique that few other states have and will aid Utahns and visitors alike with access to more areas of the state. </p>
<p>Phase I of the project is currently in progress, as <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/coordinating-a-statewide-recreational-trails-gis-dataset/">discussed last summer</a>. Phase 1 includes acquiring a database as starting point, which is available for download <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/data/recreation/trails/">here</a>, and establishing a trails and trail heads <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar7VwMWMy3Z6dDVzUHYzV2NQZXlLUC12MG9qUFdyQmc#gid=0">data standard</a>. Phase I also includes coordinating with county, city, state and public land stakeholders to built the database, which will be key to the success of this project. Phase II will include building an integrated state trails web application, similar to <a href="http://www.mapwv.gov/trails/">West Virginia's Trail Inventory</a>.    </p>
