The 1,000 Miles Campaign is looking for the help of Utah city, county, and state agency GIS experts across the state to
help track all new family friendly (criteria explained below) bike paths, lanes, and trails completed
since May of 2017.

We are looking for shapefiles, maps, or comprehensive descriptions for any new trail meeting the criteria shown below. 
{{ contact | strip_newlines }} and make sure to include your name, project name, location, distance, and a short description of the type of
infrastructure. As soon as we verify the information, we will put it all this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkSaARZNNcgHQZKaW2sVoCJ4cnSKIk4nVca29y_6l-w/edit#gid=0) where it will be
shared with the Governor's office and public. A storymap is also being created for displaying this data as the campaign progresses.

## So, what counts?

- **Mountain bike and hiking trails.** A range of difficulties are allowed so long as signage is posted indicating the level of difficulty, newly constructed trails qualify.
- **Paved bike and multi-use trails.** Both on-street bike infrastructure and off-street paths can be counted provided they fit into one of the three categories shown below:

## About the 1,000 miles campaign

In 2017 Governor Herbert and Lieutenant Governor Cox initiated the 1,000 Miles Campaign to build 1,000 new miles of family-friendly bike paths, lanes, and trails by 2027.

Bike Utah is honored to be the nonprofit partner designated to carry out the implementation of the 1,000 Miles Campaign. 

_And, tracking progress is just one of our responsibilities._ **We can also provide strategic planning, technical assistance, and connections to financial resources**, so communities can begin or continue developing bicycling in their area.
