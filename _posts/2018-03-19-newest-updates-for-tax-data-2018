With April being just around the corner it’s tax time again. If you don’t procrastinate and have already done your taxes, you might be interested in knowing just who is getting that hard earned money you make. Well we have data for that.

Newest Tax Entities and Areas for 2017
This is the final list of all entities for 2017, these are the incorporated bodies that have the power to levy a local property tax such as school districts, cities, special service districts, even mosquito abatement districts. While these do not represent exact legal boundaries, they are used by USTC Property Tax Division for assessing properties.
While the entities can overlap, the areas represent individual polygons of intersecting  entities. 
 
Newest Sales Tax areas for Quarter 1, 2018
Sales Tax Areas are created from the municipal boundaries, metro townships, special sales tax districts and the unincorporated areas. They represent the approximate boundaries of Sales Tax Collection Areas in Utah.

Updated Transit Special Tax Areas.
These represent areas outside of incorporated municipalities where additional sales tax is collected to support transit activities (generally buses). As cities grow and annex the unincorporated areas the transit areas get smaller.
