<h4><strong>Oil and Gas</strong></h4>
<p>
    <br />
    <strong>Data Type: GIS Data Layer</strong><br />
    <strong>Steward(s): AGRC & DNR-OGM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br /> These datasets depict oil and gas well surface points, units and fields polygons from the <a href="http://ogm.utah.gov">Utah Department of Natural Resources, Oil, Gas and Mining Division.</a></p>
<p>The data can be previewed in an <a href="https://datamining.ogm.utah.gov/">interactive map</a> format. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
    On June 1, 2017, the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining retired 5 old databases and went online with a new database. This prompted many changes to the data field names and content previously provided in the AGRC files. This new database was developed by contractors sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection Council. The structure is much more complex than what was used in the past. The benefit is that it provides for the opportunity for the Division to collect more descriptive down-hole information for each wellbore permitted and drilled. Initially, much of the down-hole information will not be available because there was no place to save it in the previous databases. Eventually, as new wells are drilled and old legacy data is entered, more descriptive data will become available for the wells in Utah.
