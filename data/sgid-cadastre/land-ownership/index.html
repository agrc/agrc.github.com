<h4>Land Ownership</h4>
<p><strong>Data Type:</strong> GIS Data Layer<br />
<strong>Steward(s):</strong> SITLA, BLM, &amp; Partners<br />
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br />Cadastre.LandOwnership feature class depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for the State of Utah surface lands at a scale of 1:24,000.  Maintenance of this data layer is performed by a cooperative federal and state effort between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA).  Cadastre.LandOwnership is a statewide dataset of land ownership status, and therefore is a compilation of all surface land ownership administration, and designation categories.  Both the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) update this dataset regularly.  Revisions of the dataset are made available weekly through the AGRC SGID Database Server.  Standard colors are recommended when displaying this feature class. A layer file containing the standard color scheme is available by contacting SITLA GIS staff directly by calling 801-538-5100, emailing <a href="mailto: TLA-GIS@utah.gov">TLA-GIS@utah.gov</a>, or visiting <a href="http://trustlands.utah.gov">http://trustlands.utah.gov</a>.

        <p>
            Describes the "Type" of Land Use or Designation. This field characterizes general land management designations for parcels of land and describes how, or for what use the land is to be managed (ex: Designated as Wilderness, National Park, State Park). This field can accommodate, if necessary, further withdrawals, leases, or permits designated by the ADMIN. E.g. If the USFS places a withdrawal on a parcel, i.e. for wilderness designation, the DESIG field can be used to account for this case. However, only a single designation can be addressed in the DESIG field; we cannot account for multiple withdrawals, leases, or permits on a parcel in this data standard. The data steward or editor must decide the most pertinent information to describe in the DESIG field.

            The following land ownership-related data layers can easily be derived from Cadastre.LandOwnership by using subset (defintion) queries to select a specific set of features:

            <img class="productImage-Thumb" src="{{ "/images/LandOwernship_Federal.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Changeme" /><strong>Land owned by the Federal Government.</strong>  This includes land administered by the US Bureau of Land Management, the US Bureau of Reclamation, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Energy, the US National Park Service, the Utah State Department of Wildlife Resources, the US Forest Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and, in some cases, the Utah State Department of State Parks. To work with only federal lands, specify a SELECT Where Clause of:
