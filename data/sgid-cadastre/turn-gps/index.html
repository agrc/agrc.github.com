<h4><strong>The Utah Reference Network (TURN) GPS</h4>
<p></strong></p>
<p><strong>TURN GPS uses the Trimble PIVOT VRS Platform</strong></p>

<p>The Utah Reference Network (TURN) GPS is a GNSS network of permanently located GPS receivers,
installed across the state, to generate real time high accuracy GPS positioning. 
TURN GPS is used for a range of precision GPS applications including surveying,
engineering, construction and GIS data collection.
Current cost is $600 for each User login and is good for a full year from date of signup.</p>
<h2 class="text-left">Creating a New Account:</h2>
<p>From the <a href="https://secure.utah.gov/turngps/">TURN GPS secure payment site</a>,
select the 'New Registration' button, accept the Terms and Conditions (if you agree),
go through the steps filling account and credit card payment info. Two registration hints:
<ul><li>For the Organization and Username don't use any punctuation.</li><li>Please put some thought into your Username, as that will be associated with your account ongoing.</li></ul>
When registration and payment are complete you will receive a confirmation email and receipt. It will take about 24 hours for the subscription payment to cycle through and your account to be activated and ready for use in the field.</p>
<h2 class="text-left">Renewing An Account: </h2>
<p>Again, from the <a href="https://secure.utah.gov/turngps/">TURN GPS secure payment site</a>,
select the 'Renew Subscription' button, accept the Terms and Conditions (if you agree).</p>
Provide the Organization, Username, and Password for the subscription you're renewing, and
proceed to the payment portion using a credit card. When done you will receive a confirmation email and receipt.</p>
<p>If the account has expired, it will take about 24 hours for the subscription payment to cycle through
and the activation to be complete for field work, otherwise you will not notice any interruption.</p>
<p>With an activated subscription, set your GPS unit's VRS connection address to 168.179.231.9 and enter your new device-specific username and password.</p>
<h2 class="text-left">Additional Information</h2>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Paid subscription; Login, Password required</p>

<p>The Coordinate Reference Frame for this network is NAD83(2011)(EPOCH:2010.0000.)
The Latitude, Longitude and Ellipsoidal Height of each reference station was calculated
by processing 24 hour files using the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Online Positioning User Service (OPUS)
Projects application.</p>
<p>Eighteen NGS Continually Operating Reference Stations (CORS) were selected along the 
perimeter and interior of the network and were constrained to the published coordinates to conduct the final
adjustment of the network coordinates.</p>
