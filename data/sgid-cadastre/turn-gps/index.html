<h4><strong>The Utah Reference Network (TURN) GPS</h4>
<p></strong></p>
<p><strong>Software: Trimble PIVOT Platform</strong><br />
<strong>TURN GPS on the Trimble Pivot Web</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
The Utah Reference Network (TURN) GPS is a network of permanently located GPS receivers, installed across the state as shown in the map, through partnerships between Cities, Counties and State using equipment and facilities, to generate real time high accuracy GPS positioning. TURN GPS is used for a range of precision GPS applications including surveying, engineering, construction and GIS data collection.<br />
Current cost is $600 for each User login and is good for a full year.<br />

The Utah Reference Network is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) which provides both real time corrections and data for post processing to those that have an active subscription.  The Coordinate Reference Frame for this network is NAD83(2011)(EPOCH:2010.0000.) The Latitude, Longitude and Ellipsoidal Height of each reference station was calculated by processing 24 hour files using the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) Projects application. Eighteen NGS Continually Operating Reference Stations (CORS) were selected along the perimeter and interior of the network and were constrained to the published coordinates to conduct the final adjustment of the network coordinates. </p>
