<p>High resolution aerial photography is a critical foundation for GIS users but a statewide mosaic of imagery almost demands that you have your own high end storage solution.</p>
<p>The SGID ImageServer eliminated the need to maintain your own imagery collection by providing statewide aerial photography, hillshade, and scanned maps services to ArcMap user via a high speed internet connection.Â Very easy to use.</p>
<p><em><strong>For ArcMap 9.3 or 10 users:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the ArcMap Customize window</li>
<li>Click the Commands tab</li>
<li>Select the Image Server category and drag the Add Image Server Connection button on to the standard toolbar next to the yellow and black 'Add Data' button</li>
<li>Close the Customize window and click on the Add Image Server Connection button.</li>
<li>For Server Name, type in: image.agrc.utah.gov</li>
<li>Browse the folders (see below) for an image service of your choice, click Add and then OK</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To use Image Server, you will need to be able to send and receive requests on ports 3982, 3983, and 3984. Check with your network administrator to see that these ports are open through your firewall.</li>
<li>2009 aerial photography is available at 1 meter resolution statewide and 1 foot resolution in Utah's urban core and several outlying areas (Cache County, Canyonlands/Moab area). 2006 1 foot photography has a larger footprint including along most of the state and federal highway system.</li>
<li>The Elevation --&gt; Hillshade_10Meter4Way services provides the best cartographic hillshade/terrain display</li>
<li>USGS Topographic Maps are available under the ScannedMaps folder available via an ImageServer connection</li>
<li>If you are runing ArcGIS 9.3 or higher, the client should be pre-installed along with the ArcGIS software. You'll just need to add the Add Image Service button from the Customize Window --&gt; Categories --&gt; Image Server to an existing ArcMap toolbar.</li>
<li>If you are an ArcGIS 9.1 or 9.2 user or a CAD user, you'll need to install the Image Server client. This client is free and complete installation instructions are available from the agrc ftp site: <a href="ftp://ftp.agrc.utah.gov/Temp/ImageServer_Client.zip">ftp://ftp.agrc.utah.gov/Temp/ImageServer_Client.zip</a> . Included in the zip file is a MS Word document called IS_Client_Install.doc, with the installation instructions.</li>
</ul>
