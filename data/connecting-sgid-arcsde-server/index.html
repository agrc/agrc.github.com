title: Connecting to the SGID ArcSDE Server
categories: []
---
<p>AGRC's ArcSDE database server contains SGID's vector-format GIS feature classes.</p>
<p>ArcMap users can make a live connection to the ArcSDE Server using the public, read only user and password shown below.</p>
<p>Performance is highly dependent on the speed of the user's downstream internet connection. Greater than 10 Mbps is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>When to use?</strong><br />
Using the a database connection to the most current ArcSDE server can be advantageous as users will see and query the most updated version of all feature classes housed at AGRC. Live connections are excellent for browsing, exploring, or making quick maps with SGID data layers. However,  users are encouraged to download or export data files where editing, archiving project data, or optimal performance is required. Additionally, it is recommended and in some cases required that users' ArcMap release version be at or above the level of AGRC's ArcSDE server.</p>
<p><strong>How to directly connect to the SGID ArcSDE 10.0 Server: </strong></p>
<p>1. In ArcCatalog browse in the Catalog Tree to the option "Add Spatial Database Connection"</p>
<p><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center" src="{{ "/images/gallery/sgid/addspatialdataconnection.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="addspatialdataconnection" /><br />
2. Provide the connection information you see below. The password is 'agrc'.</p>
<p><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-center" src="{{ "/images/gallery/sgid/connectionpropertiessgid_0.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="connectionpropertiessgid" /></p>
<p>3. Click on the connection you just established to select, preview and add ArcSDE-based feature classes of your choice.<br />
<strong>SGID Organization</strong></p>
<p>The SGID's organization is based on ISO Topic Categories. AGRC treats the ISO categories as a guideline, and the main goal is to maximize usability for GIS users.</p>
