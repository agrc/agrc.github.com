<h4 class="package--header">Web API Address Locators</h4>
<ul class="dotless no-padding">
  <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> Address Locator Service
  <li><strong>Steward(s):</strong> AGRC
  <li><strong>Web Application:</strong> <a href="https://api.mapserv.utah.gov">https://api.mapserv.utah.gov</a>
  <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> AGRC offers a geocoding web service API to return geographic coordinates for Utah addresses using the SGID Transportation.Roads and Location.AddressPoints feature classes as reference data. This API can be accessed over http programmatically (with standard HTTP get request) without the use of GIS-specific software - such as a web application. This geocoding API uses 'front end' logic to resolve several common address standardization issues above and beyond what out-of-the-box geocoders handle. The downloadable ArcGIS Locator Packages described below are copies of the 'back end' services that are used directly by the geocoding API.
  <li><strong>Using the API Locators:</strong> </br> For geocoding within a programming environment, it is recommended that you use the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-04-02-using-the-mapserv-utah-gov-api-to-geocode-address %}' title='geocoding API web service'>geocoding API web service</a>. </br> Within ArcGIS, the geocoding API can be accessed using our <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-17-new-utah-geocoding-toolbox-for-arcgis-desktop-2 %}' title='custom geoprocessing tool'</a>custom geoprocessing tool</a>. </br> Additionally, we offer a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/utah-address-locator/nepmlneiknaeojhadbeodpaefenhjkek?utm_source=permalink"> Google Sheets Add-on (via Chrome browser)</a> that provides geocoding directly within a spreadsheet. This can be used by anyone with a utah.gov email address.

<h4 class="package--header">ArcGIS Desktop Locators</h4>
<ul class="dotless no-padding">
  <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> ArcGIS Locator Package (.gcpk)
  <li><strong>Steward(s):</strong> AGRC
  <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> AGRC also offers traditional ArcGIS Desktop address locators. These are downloadable address locators that are built using the SGID Transportation.Roads and Location.AddressPoints feature classes as reference data. These are the 'back end' locators for the Web API address locators described above. They are rebuilt monthly based on the statweide roads update schedule.

    <p>Locator_RoadsZip_COMPOSITE.loc is an ArcGIS 10 composite address locator that references the statewide Transportation.Roads feature class and uses the ZIP_LEFT and ZIP_RGHT fields for zone. This address locator has four levels of street name aliasing to include alternate street names and address grid coordinate system names. For example, Redwood Road is aliased as both Highway 68 and 1700 West.</p>

This address locator has four levels of street name aliasing to include alternate street names and address grid coordinate system names. For example, Redwood Road is aliased as both Highway 68 and 1700 West. By using the address quadrant system for zone, applications and users will be able to match addresses even if the city or zip code supplied is close but not exact or when a location is at or near the border of two zones.</p>
