  <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> Address Locator Service
  <li><strong>Steward(s):</strong> AGRC
  <li><strong>Web Application:</strong> <a href="https://api.mapserv.utah.gov">https://api.mapserv.utah.gov</a>
  <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Below are address locators for geocoding that reference the Location.AddressPoints and statewide Transportation.Roads feature classes. The input address data should be separated into two columns, standardized addresses and address quadrant system. Addresses should be formatted to include the house number, prefix direction, street, street type, suffix direction, and address quadrant system. AGRC offers a geocoding web service API to return geographic coordinates for Utah addresses using road centerline and/or address point reference data. This API can be accessed over http programmatically without the use of GIS-specific software, like from a web application. The geocoding API can also be used from within the ArcGIS software environment using a <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-17-new-utah-geocoding-toolbox-for-arcgis-desktop-2 %}' title='custom geoprocessing tool'>custom geoprocessing tool</a> that AGRC developed. The geocoding API uses 'front end' logic to resolve several common address standardization issues above and beyond what out-of-the-box geocoders handle. The ArcGIS locator files shown below are copies of the 'back end' of the service that are used directly by the geocoding API. They are provided for reference but will not work well in all settings. For geocoding, it is recommended that you use the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-04-02-using-the-mapserv-utah-gov-api-to-geocode-address %}' title='geocoding API web service'>geocoding API web service</a> (which works on the web traffic standard)

    <p>Locator_RoadsZip_COMPOSITE.loc is an ArcGIS 10 composite address locator that references the statewide Transportation.Roads feature class and uses the ZIP_LEFT and ZIP_RGHT fields for zone. This address locator has four levels of street name aliasing to include alternate street names and address grid coordinate system names. For example, Redwood Road is aliased as both Highway 68 and 1700 West.</p>

By using the address quadrant system for zone, applications and users will be able to match addresses even if the city or zip code supplied is close but not exact or when a location is at or near the border of two zones.</p>

    <p>Locator_AddressPtsZip.loc is an ArcGIS 10 address locator that references the Location.AddressPoints feature class and uses zip code for zone. Geocoding match rates will improve with the Locator_AddressPtsZip.loc address locator as the Location.AddressPoints feature class continues to be developed.</p>
