<h4><strong>Address Locators</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Data Type:</strong> Locator Services<br />
<strong>Steward(s):</strong> AGRC</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
AGRC offers a geocoding web service API to return geographic coordinates for Utah addresses using road centerline and/or address point reference data.</p>
<p>This API can be called programmatically without the use of GIS-specific software, like from a web application. The geocoding API can also be used from within the ArcGIS software environment using a <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/new-utah-geocoding-toolbox-for-arcgis-desktop-2/" title="custom geoprocessing tool" target="_blank">custom geoprocessing tool</a> that AGRC developed.</p>
<p>The geocoding API uses 'front end' logic to resolve several common address standardization issues above and beyond what out-of-the-box geocoders handle. The ArcGIS locator files shown below are copies of the SDE-based locators on the 'back end' of the service and are used directly by the geocoding API. They are provided for reference but will not work well in all settings, particularly where your firewall is restricting or delays requests on port 5151.</p>
<p><strong>For geocoding, it is recommended that you use the <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/using-the-mapserv-utah-gov-api-to-geocode-address/" title="geocoding API web service" target="_blank">geocoding API web service</a> (which works on the web traffic standard, port 80) or set up a local implementation of reference data and address locators. AGRC may look at including locators in the road centerline and address point downloadable data 'packages' in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Below are address locators (.loc files) for geocoding that reference the Location.AddressPoints and statewide Transportation.Roads feature classes. The ingoing address data should be separated into two columns, standardized addresses and zones (zip code or address quadrant system). Addresses should be formatted to include the house number, prefix direction, street, street type, suffix direction, and zip code or address quadrant system. Examples of standardized address include:</p>

[tab title="Description"]<img class="productImage-Thumb" src="http://gis.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/CompZip90x90.png" alt="Changeme" />Locator_RoadsZip_COMPOSITE.loc is an ArcGIS 10 composite address locator that references the statewide Transportation.Roads feature class and uses the ZIP_LEFT and ZIP_RGHT fields for zone. This address locator has four levels of street name aliasing to include alternate street names and address grid coordinate system names. For example, Redwood Road is aliased as both Highway 68 and 1700 West.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>[/tab]</p>
<p>[tab title="Usage"]<br />
Since the four address locators that make up the composite service use reference data stored in ArcSDE, you do not need to dowdnload the roads dataset. However, you will need a moderately fast internet connection to use this locator. The locator is designed to be used in ArcMap's geocoding toolbar or ArcToolbox.</p>
<p>To inquire about using AGRC's geocoding web service which utilizes similar locators both zipcode and standardized city names for the zone parameter and can resolve route/milepost addresses, please contact <a href="mailto:%20mpeters@utah.gov">Matt Peters</a> with AGRC's application development group. [/tab]</p>
<p>[tab title="Updates"] Updates to the composite address locator coincide with the Transportation.Roads update schedule. Updates to the Roads dataset are published every month with apporximately 5 counties' receiving detailed review during each update cycle.  Updated: January 13, 2016</p>
