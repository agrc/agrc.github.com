Description and Usage
SGID93.Transportation.Roads is a multi-purpose statewide roads dataset for cartography and range based-address location. This dataset is updated every 2 months with an update focus of approximately 6 counties per cycle. Network analysis and linear referencing system datasets are derived from attributes stored within this dataset. SGID93.Transportation.Roads employs what has been referred to as the Utah Transportation Data Model. This data model is currently under active review by the UGIC Standards Committee and will likely be revised in the coming months. (detailed metadata)
