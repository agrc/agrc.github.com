    <p>Transportation.Roads is a multi-purpose statewide roads dataset for cartography and range based-address location. This dataset is also used as the base geometry for deriving the GIS-representation of UDOT’s highway linear referencing system (LRS). A network analysis dataset for route-finding can also be derived from this dataset.</p>
    <p>Transportation.Roads utilizes a data model based on Next-Generation 911 standards and the Federal Highway Administration's All Roads Network Of Linear-referenced Data (ARNOLD) reporting requirements for state DOTs. AGRC <a href="{% link _posts/2017-08-15-major-updates-coming-to-roads-data-model.md %}">adopted</a> this data model on September 13th, 2017.</p>
    <p>To see specific information about the data model including field names and descriptions, data types, coded value domains, and data model updates, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546">data model spreadsheet</a> and the corresponding tabs for update notes and coded value domains. The color-coded section titled <code>Addressing</code> is primarily maintained by the local stewards, where as the section titled <code>DOT/FHWA</code> is primarily maintained by UDOT. AGRC spatially assigns fields in the section titled <code>Placename/Area</code>, based on current SGID polygon boundaries. AGRC also generates the <code>UNIQUE_ID</code> field based on the segment's location in the US National Grid, with the street name then tacked on. The <code>UNIQUE_ID</code> field is static and is AGRC's current, ad hoc solution to a persistent global id.</p>
    <p>This data model is meant to suggest 'best practices'. It is not the intent that all stewards will change their current data management process to match this standard, but rather that stewards will evaluate their current practices to see how well their data 'maps' to this schema for data sharing and Next Generation 911 preparedness.</p>
    <p>{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.roads %}</p>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). The statewide roads dataset is maintained by AGRC in partnership with local government, the Utah 911 Committee, and UDOT.</p>

    <p>Transportation.UDOTRoutes_LRS is a polylineM dataset wherein each state and federal route is a single feature whose vertices include a milepost measure coordinate.</p>
    <p>Major routes are named using UDOT’s 5 character convention (ex. 0089P is US 89 in the positive direction). Ramps and collectors are also included and have 11 character identifiers (ex. 0080PR18501 is the east bound off ramp at exit 185 on I-80). ‘P’ direction routes are those in the direction of increasing milepost values. ‘N’ direction routes for the Utah’s 5 freeways (0015, 0070, 0080, 0084, 0215) should be ignored (use ‘X’ instead) except when working with UDOT-specific LRS event features.</p>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter x,y coordinate precision; 0.001 mile m coordinate precision). The GIS dataset representing the UDOT LRS is stewarded by UDOT with assistance from DTS, AGRC and local government.</p>
    <p>The CARTO code can be used to query subsets or classify different types of UDOT routes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1: Interstate highways
      <li>2: US highways
      <li>3: State highways
      <li>5: Miscellaneous routes associated with interchanges
      <li>6: Ramps, Interstates
      <li>7: Ramps, US Highways
      <li>8: Ramps, State highways
      <li>9: Local routes, federal aid eligible
      <li>I: Institutional roads designated as state highways
    </ul>
