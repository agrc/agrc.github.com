resolution imagery available, including 1 foot resolution color imagery, NAIP, 1 meter resolution imagery, and 1 meter
USGS DOQs. The dataset has been updated to include cartographic attribution for fine scale representations and also a
differentiation between light, heavy, transit, and electrified tracks."

    <p>Railroad mileposts are used to reference locations along railroads by the closest quarter milepost number and
      railroad division name. The points are intended to improve dispatch of emergency services along mainline
      railroads.</p>
    <p>The statewide roads dataset is maintained by UGRC and created from distances along Utah Railroads in combination
      with railroad mileposts provided by the Federal Railway Administration.</p>
