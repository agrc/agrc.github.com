The dataset has been updated to include cartographic attribution for fine scale representations and also a differentiation between light, heavy, transit, and electrified tracks."

    <p>Railroad mileposts are used to reference locations along railroads by the closest quarter milepost number and railroad division name. The points are intended to improve dispatch of emergency services along mainline railroads.</p>
    <p>The statewide roads dataset is maintained by AGRC and created from distances along SGID10.TRANSPORTATION.Railroads in combination with railroad mileposts provided by the Federal Railway Administration.</p>
