title: How to Connect to the SGID via ArcSDE
categories: []
---
<p>The SGID is also available via an ArcSDE database connection for users within the State of Utah network.  Users with ArcGIS desktop clients that are at 10.2.1 or higher can use this resource.  Organized loosely around ISO categories, feature classes within ArcSDE are accessible by an ArcMap or ArcCatelog client.  The big benefits for doing so are that you connect to the most current data, your hard drive won't fill up as fast, and all the data is available in the same place.</p>
<p>How to connect to SGID via ArcSDE connection:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> In ArcCatalog or ArcMap (from Add Data), browse to Add Spatial Database Connections</p>
<p><img src="{{ "/images/connect_tree.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Provide the following connection information, including the password 'agrc'.</p>
