    <p>Society.Schools represents point locations of schools in the State of Utah. Schools of all levels from pre-kindgergarten to higher education are included. The sources for the list of schools in this dataset are the Utah State Office of Education and the Utah Education Network (UEN). AGRC used a combination of geocoding and manual placement (digitizing) to identify the geographic location of each school.</p>
