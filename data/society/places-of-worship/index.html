    <p>The definition of a place of worship is any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. This does not include religious schools or community centers, unless they meet the definition as a place of worship. Examples of facilities in this dataset are chapels, churches, convents, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The sources of this dataset are the Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities dataset and additional AGRC research.</p>
