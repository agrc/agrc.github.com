    <p>Location.AddressPoints is a statewide dataset that contains address point data from all 29 Utah Counties. This dataset is a work in progress and some counties are more complete than others. One person in each county has been identified as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkScYXX9W5INdFFRVHZkcWFYczd5MXhZYS1WTVN1elE&usp=sharing">Master Address List</a> (MAL) Authority to eliminate duplication of address point data and to clarify the main person of contact. AGRC is working with each MAL Authority to continually improve this data and work toward monthly updates.</p>
    <h5>Address Points in Action</h5>
    <p>The statewide address point layer is used as reference data for the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-05-10-utah-statewide-address-geocoding-web-service-upgrade %}">api.mapserv.utah.gov</a> address locators. You can also find the address points in many <a href="https://atlas.utah.gov">web mapping applicaitons</a>.</p>
    <h5>Address Points as a Service</h5>
    <p>The address points are published as an <a href="http://utah.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5b92021338f64f5ba77765d6fc47cbc9">ArcGIS Online service</a> as well as a <a href="{{ "/discover" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Discover service</a>.</p>

    <p>Location.AddressSystemQuadrants represents the local and countywide address system quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW) throughout Utah. Addresses are assigned by local government addressing authorities using a defined addressing system, or grid. An addressing system consists of an origin point (0,0), a north-south axis, and an east-west axis, and a boundary within which addresses are assigned using this particular grid. This convention governs the assignment of addresses and is typically expressed as 100 address ranges per block or 800 address ranges per mile. Updates to this dataset are published periodically.</p>
