<img class="productImage-Thumb" src="{{ "/images/AddPts_Small.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Changeme" />Location.AddressPoints is a statewide dataset that contains address point data from all 29 Utah Counties. This dataset is a work in progress and some counties are more complete than others. One person in each county has been identified as the Master Address List (MAL) Authority to eliminate duplication of address point data and clarify the main person of contact. AGRC is working with each MAL Authority to continually improve this data and work toward quarterly updates.</p>

Addresses are assigned by local government addressing authorities using a defined addressing system, or grid. An addressing system consists of an origin point (0,0), a north-south axis, and an east-west axis, and a boundary within which addresses are assigned using this particular grid. This convention governs the assignment of addresses and is typically expressed as 100 address ranges per block or 800 address ranges per mile.</p>
