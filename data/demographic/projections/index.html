abstract="Utah's 4 Metropolitan Planning Organizations, together with UDOT for the state's non-urbanized areas, prepare small area demographic and employment projections to support the transportation planning process. These small area projections are developed from county-level totals projected by the <a href='https://gardner.utah.edu/demographics/population-projections/'>University of Utah Gardner Policy Institute</a>. Two small area geographies are available: Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ's) polygons and City Area polygons. TAZ's average about 1 square mile in size along the Wasatch Front but are larger in rural areas. City Areas are approximations of city boundaries built by combining TAZ polygons.<br /><br /><em>All links below point at ‘open data’ pages from which shapefiles, KML, CSV, and web services can be downloaded or utilized.</em>" %}
