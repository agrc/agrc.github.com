<h4>GAP Landcover Classification (Vector)</h4>
<p><strong>Data Type:</strong> Map Data<br />
<strong>Steward(s):</strong> AGRC, Local Government partners<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> Address points for Utah counties (10 complete and 6 partial). This dataset is not yet available, but will hopefully be available to the public soon.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
In Utah, addresses are assigned by local government addressing authorities using a defined addressing system, or grid. Typically, an addressing system consists of an origin (0,0) point, a north-south axis, an east-west axis, a</p>
<p>convention that governs the assignment of addresses, typically expressed as the number of (100 address range) blocks per mile, and a boundary within which which addresses are assigned using this particular grid. This dataset contains the NW, NE, SE, and SW address quadrants for all address systems in Utah.</p>
