Do you need a quick, fast base map for your [GIS, CAD, or web services]({{ "/discover/#connect" | prepend: site.baseurl }})? AGRC provides several multi-scale base map and imagery service options that deliver pre-rendered base map tiles to your platform as fast as your internet connection will allow.

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Everyone wanting to use the AGRC base maps needs to have a [free account]({{ "/discover/" | prepend: site.baseurl }} "#web-mercator-services-on-discover") and a quad word key created for them**. <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>

AGRCâ€™s cloud-based server, [Discover]({{ "/discover/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), provides imagery and base map services in an OGC standard WMTS and WMS in the Web Mercator WGS84 projection (wkid: 3857). There are over [20 services]({{ "/discover/#services" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) available from Discover that are free to use. **A subset of services do require a [signed license agreement]({{ "/discover/license" | prepend: site.baseurl }})**.

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-info-circle"></i> Each cache consists of around **3 to 17 million** 256 pixel square tiles that can range from **15G to over 200GB**. These caches are standardized on a subset of the Google, Microsoft, and esri [scale levels]({{ "/developer/base-maps/basemap-scales/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that apply to our state. The [update schedule]({{ "/developer/base-maps/basemap-maintenance-schedule/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) will keep you in the loop as to when the tiles were last updated. If you would like to download imagery visit the [aerial photography]({{ "/data/aerial-photography/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) data page.

#### The Services on Discover

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-map"></i> **Terrain**: This base map highlights elevation with mountain peak elevation labels, contour lines, ski resorts, as well as many other places of interest.

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-map"></i> AGRC maintains a very minimal cache called **Lite**. It is very muted in color and does not distract from data overlayed on top of it.

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-map"></i> Up next is the **Imagery** base map. This tile set shows the Google aerial photography. You will need to qualify for an [organizational account login]({{ "/discover/license" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to use to this base map for licensing reasons.

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-map"></i> An exciting offering, _that we call squiggles and dots internally_, is a service called **Overlay**. This is a transparent set of tiles that displays styled roads and placenames. This can be overlayed on data for reference. Combining this with **Imagery** can create a desired **Hybrid** effect.

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-map"></i> We have the **Color Infrared**, **Address Points** and **Topo** caches. The Color Infrared is a neat way to look at vegetation while the Topo cache contains all of the USGS Quad Sheets. The Topo cache displays the most relevant quad sheet (250K, 100K and 24K) depending on your scale. The Address Points cache is a fast way to view around 2.5 million address points.

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-map"></i> There are also historical NAIP and Google imagery.
