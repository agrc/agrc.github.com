<p>Water Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Streams &amp; Other Water Courses.<br />
SGID93.Water.StreamsNHD_HighRes is the recommended data layer for depicting Utah's streams, canals, washes, etc. This is a large dataset that is derived from the National Hydrology Database (NHD) compiled by the UGSS in partnership with AGRC and other states' GIS programs. Users of this dataset should familiarize themselves with several key attributes:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">NHD Attributes<br />
FCODE attribute can be used to classify water course features by functional type<br />
FNAME is the name of the water course</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">AGRC maintained codes for cartography<br />
ISMAJOR can be used to query only the major water courses for coarse scale mapping<br />
ISSUBMERGED can be used to exclude the hydrologic network features that have been added across water bodies to the NHD dataset for linear water flow modeling<br />
INUTAH can be used to exclude water courses outside the state boundary. All water courses features that cross the state boundary have been split and attributed (1 = in Utah and 0 = outside Utah)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lakes &amp; Other Water Bodies<br />
SGID93.Water.LakesNHD_HighRes is the recommended data layer for depicting Utah's lakes, reservoirs, and smaller features, etc. This data is derived from the National Hydrology Database (NHD) compiled by the UGSS in partnership with AGRC and other states' GIS programs. Users of this dataset should familiarize themselves with several key attributes:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">NHD codes<br />
FCODE attribute can be used to classify water body features by functional type<br />
FNAME is the name of the water bodyfeature</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">AGRC maintained codes for cartography<br />
ISMAJOR can be used to query only the major lakes for coarse scale mapping<br />
INUTAH can be used to exclude water bodies outside the state boundary. All water bodies features that cross the state boundary have been split and attributed (1 = in Utah and 0 = outside Utah)</p>
<ul>
<li>Springs<br />
SGID93.Water.SpringsNHD_HighRes depicts spring features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water Management</p>
<ul>
<li>Points of Diversion depicts agricultural irrigation and other diversion points at or along water features. This dataset is stewarded by the Utah Division of Water Resources. Contact <a href="mailto:leschler@utah.gov">Lee Eschler</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Source Water Protection Zones (Drinking Water) are maintained by the Utah Division of Drinking Water. This dataset is considered a protected record. Those with a legimate need for this data are invited to contact <a href="mailto:mjensen@utah.gov">Mark Jensen</a> or <a href="mailto:kjohnson@utah.gov">Kate Johnson</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Water-Related Land Use characterizes the type of water usage (irrigation, crop type, urban uses, etc) for land, statewide (see SGID Planning for moredetail).</li>
</ul>
