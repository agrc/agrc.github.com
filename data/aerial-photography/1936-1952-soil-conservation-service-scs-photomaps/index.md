AGRC has 1-meter Black and White Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Photomaps from 1936-1952. This is not a statewide coverage. The Photomaps have a UTM NAD27 projection. The date the photo was taken can be found for some of the tiles in the _Year_ field of the [tile-index](ftp://ftp.agrc.utah.gov/Imagery/UGS_SCS_Historical/UGS_SCS_Historical_Index.zip).
