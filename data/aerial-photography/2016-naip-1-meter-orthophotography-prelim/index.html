<p>AGRC has the preliminary statewide <a href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/index">National Agricultural Imagery Program</a> 
  (NAIP) 3-band aerial photography for Utah in Mr. Sid county mosaics. 
  The imagery is 1-meter resolution and was collected in the summer of 2016. 
  The date the photography was flown can be found in the IDATE field in the associated shapefile. 
  Be aware some of the larger counties (ex. San Juan, Millard, Tooele and Box Elder) are no longer split 
  into multiple parts and their file size is upwards of 4 to 7 GB. The images have a UTM NAD83 meters projection.
