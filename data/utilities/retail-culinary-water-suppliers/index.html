    <p>Utah Retail Culinary Water Service Areas represent public community water suppliers. Eventually, public
      non-community (transient) and self-supplied industry (non-transient) suppliers will be added. This feature class
      includes system boundaries that are historical and no longer active. It also includes some systems that are
      outside the state. Historical and outside the state systems can be filtered using the <code>ENDYEAR</code> and
      <code>STATE</code> fields, respectively.These boundaries are derived from many different sources. They include
      spatial data received directly from the supplier, municipal boundaries, phone call descriptions of service areas,
      printed maps that had hand drawn boundaries that were then digitized, etc.
