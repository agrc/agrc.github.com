    <p>Landslide Inventory Polygons depicts landslide activity and debris flows at scales of 1:24,000 or better and were captured using LiDAR, stereo aerial photography, other data, and field reconnaissance by the UGS. Landslide Inventory Polygons represents the most recent landslide mapping efforts of the UGS, and when possible should be used first.</p>
