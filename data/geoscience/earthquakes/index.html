    <p>Geoscience.EpicentersModern represents The Utah Geological Survey Quaternary Fault and Fold Database and Map of Utah. This data is a compilation of existing information on faults and fault-related folds considered to be potential earthquake sources (i.e., “active” faults and folds). The faults and folds contained in the database are those considered to have been sources of large earthquakes (about magnitude 6.5 or greater) during the Quaternary Period (past 2.6 million years); these geologic structures are the most likely sources of large earthquakes in the future. The data set is intended to be a comprehensive source of the most current information available for characterizing active faults and folds in Utah for seismic-hazard analysis. This version of the data incorporates fault data from geologic maps and other documents formally published through 2013.</p>
