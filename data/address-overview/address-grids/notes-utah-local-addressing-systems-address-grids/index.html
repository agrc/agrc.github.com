title: Notes on Utah Local Addressing Systems (Address Grids)
categories: []
---
<p>James Wingate at Blue Stakes has compiled most of address coordinate system descriptions listed below. AGRC will update this list as most information is brought to our attention. If you have information or corrections to contribute, please post them here as a comment or email bgranberg@utah.gov.</p>
<p>AGRC is working on revising a polygon feature class that approximates the boundaries of each local address coordinate system (ACS) and each quadrant (NE, NW, SE, SW) within each local ACS. The feature class should be available by the end of January.</p>
<p>Please note, this is a work in progress.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Beaver County</strong></span></p>
<p>Municipalities with their own address origins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beaver – has own origin – Main St/Hwy 160 (0 E/W) and Center St/Hwy 21 (0 N/S)</li>
<li>Milford – has own origin – Main St/Hwy 257 (0 E\W) and Center St/ Hwy 21 (0 N/S)</li>
<li>Minersville – has own origin – Main St (0 N/S) and Center St/Hwy 130 (0 E/W)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some county addresses count off of Beaver. There may be different origins for the county addresses, but it’s hard to tell with all the null roads. Search 9300 S (8500 N next road north).<br />

</ul>
<p>* Streets in Logan containing addresses that don't count from Logan's address origin correctly (Per Chuck Shaw (Logan City GIS) and Kent Braddy (Cache Co Planning) – 11/12/2008):</p>
<p>Crockett Ave<br />
River Park Dr<br />
Teal Loop<br />
Mallard Loop<br />
South Place Dr<br />
Somerset Pl<br />
Kensington Pl<br />
Hampton Ct<br />
Stirling Pl<br />
Coventry Pl<br />
Penhurst Ln<br />
Trail Cir</p>
<p>Address numbers for all of Cache County:<br />
Even – always on South and East side of the street<br />
Odd – always on North and West side of the street</p>
<p>This is different from most cities, where even addresses are typically on the right and odds on the left as you move outward from the address origin. This is the case for the entire county, although supposedly a few addresses have deviated.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Duchesne County</strong></span></p>
<p>(compiled by: James Wingate, Blue Stakes)</p>
<p>Municipalities with their own address origins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duchesne – intersection of Main St (0 N/S) and Center St (0 E/W)</li>
<li>Myton – intersection of Main St (0 N/S) and Center St (0 E/W)</li>
<li>Roosevelt – intersection of Lagoon St (0 N/S) and State St (0 E/W)</li>
</ul>
<p>Municipalities that count from Unincorporated County address origin located at: Intersection of South Cove Rd/US 40 [200 N Roosevelt] (0 N/S) and State St (0 E/W) in Roosevelt</p>
<ul>
<li>Altamont</li>
<li>Tabiona</li>
</ul>
<p>The unincorporated county origin covers all of Duchesne County except for the areas within Duchesne City, Myton and Roosevelt city boundaries. A significant portion of Uintah County also counts from this origin, including the municipality of Ballard Town and roughly 25% of the unincorporated area.</p>
<p>Roosevelt City grid and County grid both have same 0 E/W, but their 0 N/S locations differ by two blocks. This can be slightly confusing, as evidenced by traveling north along State St in Roosevelt. Proceeding north from Lagoon St, after a few blocks you will hit 500 N (City), then 600 N (City) and then 500 N (County). This is because the county origin begins two blocks farther north than the city origin.</p>

<p>Address origins: (last edited 10/29/08)</p>
<ul>
<li>Springdale – No prefix or suffix directionals used. There is also no official address origin. If there was an origin, it would be where Zion Park Blvd (SR 9) meets the north city boundary line, which is also the border of Zion National Park. Zion Park Blvd (ZPB) would be the zero road, where addresses along the cross streets get larger as they get farther away from ZPB. But there is no standard of how far addresses count; the addresses could jump by 2 from house to house or by 50. All segments of ZPB have S as the prefix directional, since the origin would be the north city boundary. E-911 is uses address points for Springdale.
