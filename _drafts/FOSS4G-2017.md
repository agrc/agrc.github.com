The 2017 FOSS4G was held in Boston, MA with a record attendance of around 1500 attendees. That makes FOSS4G the second largest GIS tech conferance. The conference sessions were held over three days and were divided between developer and open source user sessions. The sessions were then grouped into three tracks - PostGIS, R, and QGIS. AGRC has only set up a successful proof of concept with PostGIS and no production implmenetation. Although AGRC stores a lot of data that could be used for exciting statistical analysis, we are not tasked with projects that would require R. QGIS showed some polish during the conference. If you tried QGIS in the past and were not satisfied, it might be a good time to give the software another chance.

The noticable trends in the session topics were open data and portals, containerized GIS, jupyter notebooks, leaving esri for open source software, vector tiles, serverless architectures, big data storage and query, and offline mapping capabilities. My takeaways were on a much more micro scale than these broad topics. Mainly because of the business that AGRC is in and the projects we are tasked with.

I heard the term `GeoPackage` being used frequently during the sessions. If, like me, you conpletely missed this news, in 2014 the OGC approved an open standard using SQLite 3 for storing multiple vector and raster spatial datasets in a single file similar to a file based geodatabse. The data is stored in a single `*.gpkg` file! SQLite removes a lot of the limitations and missing features of it's predecessor the shapefile and is supported on mobile devices. I was even more surprised to find out that GeoPackages have been supported in [esri desktop software since version 10.2.1](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/04/14/support-for-ogc-geopackages-in-arcgis/). Will GeoPackage adoption eclipse shapefiles? Should gis.utah.gov replace its' shapefiles with GeoPackages? The open source and private sector GIS systems are on board, I think it will hinge on engineering software.

The vendor area had an excellent variety of companies showcasing some very cool software and services. One service we have been testing is [GIS Cloud](http://www.giscloud.com/). It is a cloud based real time mapping platform for the entire workflow of your organization. This service could allow for web based distributed editing of GIS data. 

Esri was also in attendance talking about Open data hubs and esri leaflet. Andrew Turner gave a compelling talk showcasing how geographic information could be dissemenated without interacting with a map. There is a [sample](http://mystreet.surge.sh/) where you can input an address to find out useful information derived from GIS like trash pickup and recylcing days. He took it a step further with Amazon Alexa integration using a very useful [Echo simulator](https://echosim.io/). The days of getting GIS data answers via a map click and pop up window are over. 

Mapzen was showcasing their search which is build on top of open data and the open source [pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias) project. Using nodejs and elastic search for geocoding is definitely something we will look into further. Their routing engine is also worth noting with it's [low stress bike routing](https://mapzen.com/blog/low-stress-bike-routing/). 

Descartes Labs showed off some amazing raster analytics. My favorite being their [GeoVisual Search](https://www.descarteslabs.com/search.html) where a user can click a box on a raster image and be presented with other areas that are similar to your selection. I used it to find nearby tennis courts.

### Noteworthy Items

- [JSGeo](http://www.jsgeo.com/) is looking for new organizers to continue hosting a great conference! If you are interested - get in touch with Brian Timoney, Steve Citron-Pousty, or Chris Helm.
- [t-rex](http://t-rex.tileserver.ch/) looks like a great tool for creating vector tiles from PostGIS data. It is also a web server for serving tiles and allows for visual styling with Maputnik. It's written in Rust so it is a single executable and fast!

Vladimir Agafonkin, aka, mourner - the creator of leaflet, presented on some awesome work he has been doing and I will highlight the ones that stood out to me.
- [concaveman](https://github.com/mapbox/concaveman) is a very fast 2D concave hull algorithm in JavaScript.
- [tile-reduce](https://github.com/mapbox/tile-reduce) is a geoprocessing library that allows you to run spatial analysis over vector tile grids in parallel "lightning fast"
- [supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster) is a crazy fast geospatial point clustering library for browsers and Nodejs.
- [cheap-ruler](https://github.com/mapbox/cheap-ruler) is a fast approximate geodesic measuring module
- [linematch](https://github.com/mapbox/linematch) is a super-fast algorithm for comparing road networks.
