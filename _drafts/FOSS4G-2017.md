The 2017 FOSS4G was held in Boston, MA with a record attendance of around 1500 attendees. The conference sessions were held over three days and grouped into three main tracks - PostGIS, R, and QGIS. AGRC has only set up a successful proof of concept with PostGIS and no production implmenetation. Although AGRC stores a lot of data that could be used for exciting statistical analysis, we are not tasked with projects that would require R. QGIS showed some polish during the conference. If you tried QGIS in the past and were not satisfied, it might be a good time to give the software another chance.

The noticable trends in session topics were open data and portals, containerized GIS, jupyter notebooks, leaving esri for QGIS, vector tiles, serverless architectures, big data storage and query, and offline mapping capabilities. **Maybe some examples or remove this entirely**?

### Dev Group Take-aways

I heard the term `GeoPackage` being used frequently during the sessions. If, like me, you conpletely missed this news, in 2014 the OGC approved an open standard using SQLite 3 for storing vector and raster spatial data. SQLite removes a lot of the limitations and missing features of the shapefile and is supported on mobile devices so this is very exciting. It is also a single `*.gpkg` file! I was even more surprised to find out that GeoPackages are supported in [esri desktop software since version 10.2.1](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/04/14/support-for-ogc-geopackages-in-arcgis/). Are shapefiles a thing of the past? Should gis.utah.gov replace all of it's shapefiles with GeoPackages? Those are the questions that I started asking. 

- [JSGeo](http://www.jsgeo.com/) is looking for new organizers to continue hosting a great conference! If you are interested - get in touch with Brian Timoney, Steve Citron-Pousty, or Chris Helm.
- [t-rex](http://t-rex.tileserver.ch/) looks like a great tool for creating vector tiles from PostGIS data. It is also a web server for serving tiles and allows for visual styling with Maputnik. It's written in Rust so it is a single executable and fast!
- [pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias) is a modular open source geocoder using Elastic Search for fast geocoding.

Vladimir Agafonkin, aka, mourner - the creator of leaflet, presented on some awesome work he has been doing and I will highlight the ones that stood out to me.
1. [concaveman](https://github.com/mapbox/concaveman) is a very fast 2D concave hull algorithm in JavaScript.
1. [tile-reduce](https://github.com/mapbox/tile-reduce) is a geoprocessing library that allows you to run spatial analysis over vector tile grids in parallel "lightning fast"
1. [supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster) is a crazy fast geospatial point clustering library for browsers and Nodejs.
1. [cheap-ruler](https://github.com/mapbox/cheap-ruler) is a fast approximate geodesic measuring module
1. [linematch](https://github.com/mapbox/linematch) is a super-fast algorithm for comparing road networks.
