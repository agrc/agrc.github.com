### Background
{: .text-left}

At the beginning of 2015, a coalition of state, regional, and local government agencies purchased a license to Google's high resolution (6 inch pixels) aerial photography (_read the original post about the [acquisition]({% post_url 2015-02-02-utah-acquires-high-resolution-aerial-photography-license %})_). In 2019, Google announced they would no longer be offering this program and we started searching for other vendors. After evaluating all our options and financial resources, we selected Hexagon Geospatial and their high-resolution imagery. BLOG POST LINK HERE

### The License
{: .text-left}

The licenses governing both the Google and Hexagon imagery are similar enough to group them together for this discussion. It allows **Utah's cities, counties, special districts, state agencies, school districts, colleges/universities, and tribes** to use the imagery in web and desktop mapping applications either from our streaming web service or from locally-stored files. **Contractors and formal partners of the immediate licensees** are also allowed to use the imagery.

The imagery is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and delivered as WMS and WMTS Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) services via AGRC's **[Discover]({% link discover/index.html %})** basemap and imagery server. You can download the original `.jp2` imagery tiles from the Discover index page or get a copy from AGRC, which keeps a master set of the imagery files.

### Who Qualifies?
{: .text-left}

- Utah state agencies
- Cities, counties, and other political subdivisions of the state of Utah
- Special districts (water, fire, etc) in the state of Utah
- Utah K-12 schools and institutions of higher education, including students working on school projects
- Tribal entities
- Contractors and formal partners of an immediate licensee
- Utah National Guard

### Who Doesn't Automatically Qualify?
{: .text-left}

- Federal agencies
- US Military
- Cities, counties, or state agencies outside of the state of Utah
- Out-of-state schools
- Non-profit entities
- Professional groups and organizations
- Community groups
- Private individuals
- Consultants and contractors

**Note**: Federal agencies, US military entities, consultants, contractors, or other formal partners **can qualify** if they are directly performing work on behalf of a qualified licensee, but only for the specific project in the contract.

**_If you don't qualify for the licensed imagery, you can sign up for Discover's general access services, which include NAIP imagery and the slightly older HRO imagery._**

### Sign Up Information
